                         * other tracks should therefore ascend after that, sorted by vote count,
                         * then by the time of insertion.
                         *

                         * it should work.
                         *
                         * The currently playing track should always be the first track in the list,
                         * which is why we assign the lowest safe integer value possible.
                         * The first part of the formula ensures sorting by time of insertion,
                         * and because we want the vote count to always outweigh the time delta,
                         * we multiply it by a very large factor (10^12 in this case) and subtract it.
